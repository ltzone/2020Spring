  \end{aligned}
  $$}
  \begin{proof}
  \par{~}

  We first prove the second statement by properties of stationary process.

  \begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
    H\left(X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n}\right) &=\sum_{i=1}^{n} H\left(X_{i} | X_{i-1}, \cdots X_{2}, X_{1}\right) \\
    & \geqslant \sum_{i=1}^{n} H\left(X_{i} | X_{i-1}, X_{i-2}, \cdots, X_{n-i+1}\right) \\
    &=\sum_{i=1}^{n} H\left(X_{n} | X_{n-1}, \cdots, X_{2}, X_{1}\right) \\
    &=n H\left(X_{n} | X_{1}, X_{2}, \cdots, X_{n-1}\right)
    \end{aligned}\label{eqn:ex1}\end{equation}

    By Equation \ref{eqn:ex1} and entropy equalities we can prove the first statement.

  \begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
    (n-1) H\left(X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n}\right) & \leqslant n H\left(X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n}\right)-H\left(X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n}\right) \\
    & \leqslant n\left[H\left(X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n}\right)-H\left(X_{n}|X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n-1}\right)\right]\\
    &=n H\left(X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n-1}\right)

\begin{exercise}[Initial conditions]{ Show, for a Markov chain, that
  $$
  H\left(X_{0} | X_{n}\right) \geq H\left(X_{0} | X_{n-1}\right)
  $$
  Thus, initial conditions $X_{0}$ become more difficult to recover as the future $X_{n}$ unfolds.}
  \begin{proof}
  For Markov Chain, we have $p(x_0|x_n,x_{n-1}) = p(x_0|x_{n-1})$. Hence
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      H(X_0|X_n,X_{n-1}) &= -\sum_{x_n,x_{n-1}} p(x_n,x_{n-1}) \sum_{x_0} p(x_0|x_n,x_{n-1}) \log    p(x_0|x_n,x_{n-1}) \\
      &= -\sum_{x_{n-1}} \left( \sum_{x_{n}} p(x_n,x_{n-1}) \right) \sum_{x_0} p(x_0|x_{n-1}) \log    p(x_0|x_{n-1})\\
      &= -\sum_{x_{n-1}} p(x_{n-1}) \sum_{x_0} p(x_0|x_{n-1}) \log    p(x_0|x_{n-1}) = H(X_0|X_{n-1})
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Since condition reduce entropy, we have $  H(X_0|X_{n-1}) = H(X_0|X_n,X_{n-1}) \le  H(X_0|X_n) $

    \begin{equation}
      I\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n} ; X_{n+1}, X_{n+2}, \ldots, X_{2 n}\right) = H(X_1,\ldots,X_n) - H(X_{n+1},\ldots,X_{2n}|X_1,\ldots,X_n)

\begin{exercise}[Piece of cake]{ A cake is sliced roughly in half, the largest piece being chosen each time, the other pieces discarded. We will assume that a random cut creates pieces of proportions
  $$
  P=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right) & \text { with probability } \frac{3}{4} \\
  \left(\frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5}\right) & \text { with probability } \frac{1}{4}
  \end{array}\right.
  $$
  Thus, for example, the first cut (and choice of largest piece) may result in a piece of size $\frac{3}{5} .$ Cutting and choosing from this piece might reduce it to size $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)$ at time $2,$ and so on. How large, to first order in the exponent, is the piece of cake after $n$ cuts?}
  \begin{solution}
  Let $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n$ denote the choice of each cut. Then after $n$ cuts, the size of the cake $W_n = \prod_{i=1}^n C_i$. By taking the logarithm at the equation, we have $\log W_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \log C_i$. Since $C_i$s are i.i.d., we can apply the law of large numbers as follows.
  \begin{equation}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n} \log W_n = E(\log C) = \frac{3}{4}\log \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \log \frac{3}{5} \approx -0.494
  \end{equation}
  Note that the equation above indicates that
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      \frac{1}{n} \log W_n &= -0.494 + o(1)
      W_n &= 2^{-0.494t +o(n)}
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  So the first order in the exponent is $\frac{3}{4}\log \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \log \frac{3}{5} \approx -0.494$.

          &= \frac{p_{10}H(p_{01})+p_{01}H(p_{10})}{p_{01}+p_{10}}
        \end{aligned}

      Note that the entropy is upper bounded by its alphabet, since
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{1}{n} H\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}\right) \le \frac{1}{n} \log |\mathcal{X}|^n = \log |\mathcal{X}|
      \end{equation}
      Hence the maximal entropy rate for this problem is $\log 2 = 1$. This can be obtained when $p_{01} = p_{10} = \frac{1}{2}$, where
      \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
          H(\mathcal{X}) &= \frac{p_{10}H(p_{01})+p_{01}H(p_{10})}{p_{01}+p_{10}} \\
          &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}  = 1
        \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}
      Therefore, $p_{01} = p_{10} = \frac{1}{2}$ maximize the entropy rate.

      We first calculate the stationary distribution $\mathbf{\mu}$.
      \begin{equation}
        \left\{\begin{array}{c}
          \mathbf{\mu}P = \mathbf{\mu} \\
          \mathbf{\mu} \mathbf{1}^T = 1
        \end{array}\right. \Rightarrow \mu = \left[\frac{1}{p+1}, \frac{p}{p+1}\right]
      \end{equation}
      By the entropy rate of Markov Chain,
      \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
          H(\mathcal{X}) &= \sum_{i=1,2} \mu_i \left(\sum_{j=1,2} - p_{ij} \log {p_{ij}}\right) \\
          &= \frac{-p\log p -(1-p)\log (1-p)}{p+1}
        \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}

    \item { We take the derivative of $H(\mathcal{X})$.
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{d H(\mathcal{X})}{dp} = \frac{\log(1-p) -\log p+\log(1-p)}{(p+1)^2} := 0 \quad 
        \Rightarrow \quad p =  \frac{3- \sqrt{5}}{2}
    \end{equation}
    The maximal entropy rate is $\log \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 0.6942$.
    }
    \item {
      The transition matrix implies that there is no possibility that the last state is 1 with the last but one state to be 1. We can calculate the $N(t)$ recursively. If the last state is 0, the previous state possibilities add up to $N(t-1)$. If the last state is 1, however, the last but one state can only be 0. Then all the previous state possibilities will add up to $N(t-2)$. Further more, we can manually check the initial length that $N(1) = 2$, $N(2) = 3$. Now we have 
      \begin{equation}
        N(t) = N(t-1) + N(t-2)
      \end{equation}
      By solving the characteristic equation we know that $N(t)$ must be in the form like
      \begin{equation}
        N(t) = C_1 (\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^n + C_2 (\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^t
      \end{equation}
      Then
      \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
          H_{0} &=\lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log N(t) \\
          &= \lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log \left(C_1 (\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^t + C_2 (\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^t\right) \\
          &= \lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log C_1 (\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^t \\
          &= \lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} t \log \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} = \log \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}
        \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}
      We find that $H_0$ is the upper bound of the entropy rate, and can be obtained with the maximum entropy found in pard (d). This is because by the property of entropy,
      \begin{equation}
        H\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}\right) \le \log |X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}| = N(t)
      \end{equation}

\begin{exercise}[Maximal entropy graphs]{Consider a random walk on a connected graph with four edges.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Which graph has the highest entropy rate?
    \item Which graph has the lowest?
  \end{enumerate}}
  \begin{solution} In a random walk, the next vertex will be arbitrarily chosen from the adjancent vertices of the current vertex. That is to say, all the edges are given the same weight.

    We can formulate this problem as follows. By the inclusion-exclusion principle, there are at most 5 vertices in the graph given four edges. Their adjancent relation can be represented in a $5\times 5$ 0-1 matrix$W$, where $W_{i j} = 0$ or $1$ and $W_{i j}=W_{j i}$.

    Then the transition probability matrix $P$ and the stationary distribution$\mu$ can be calculated.
    \begin{equation}P_{i j}=\frac{W_{i j}} {\sum_{k} W_{i k}}
    \label{trans}\end{equation}
    \begin{equation}\mu_{i}=\frac{W_{i}}{2 W}\label{mu}\end{equation}

      where $W_{i}=\sum_{j} w_{i j}$ and $W=\sum_{i} \frac{W_{i}}{2}$
  
      Then the entropy rate can be calculated as
      \begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
        H(\mathcal{X})&=H\left(X_{2} | X_{1}\right) \\
        &= H(X_2,X_1) - H(X_1)\\
        &= H(\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{8},\ldots,\frac{1}{8}) - H(\mu) \\
        &= 3 - H(\mu)
      \end{aligned}\end{equation}
      
      For 4 edges, there are five possible graphs, as has been shown in Figure \ref{fig:ex11}.

      Their corresponding entropy rates are 0.75, 0.84436, 1, 1.09436 and 1.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item {
    The fourth graph has the largest entropy rate.
    }
    \item { The first graph has the lowest entropy rate.
