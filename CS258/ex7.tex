\begin{exercise}[Capacity of the carrier pigeon channel]{Consider a commander of an army besieged in a fort for whom the only means of communication to his allies is a set of carrier pigeons. Assume that each carrier pigeon can carry one letter (8 bits), that pigeons are released once every 5 minutes, and that each pigeon takes exactly 3 minutes to reach its destination.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Assuming that all the pigeons reach safely, what is the capacity of this link in bits/hour?
    \item Now assume that the enemies try to shoot down the pigeons and that they manage to hit a fraction $\alpha$ of them. since the pigeons are sent at a constant rate, the receiver knows when the pigeons are missing. What is the capacity of this link?
    \item Now assume that the enemy is more cunning and that every time they shoot down a pigeon, they send out a dummy pigeon carrying a random letter (chosen uniformly from all 8-bit letters). What is the capacity of this link in bits/hour? Set up an appropriate model for the channel in each of the above cases, and indicate how to go about finding the capacity.
  \end{enumerate}}
  \begin{solution}
  \par{~}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item { The capacity is 8 bits/5mins $=$ 96 bits/hour.
    }
    \item { The process can be modeled as an erasure model. Consider the transmission of a pigeon of 8 bits (256 alphabets), it has the probability of $\alpha$ to be erased. We assume the message sent is $X \in \left\{0, \ldots, 256 \right\}$, the message received is $Y \in \left\{e, 0, \ldots, 256\right\}$. The capacity of a single transmission is
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        C &=\max _{p(x)} I(X ; Y) \\
        &=\max _{p(x)}(H(Y)-H(Y | X))\\
        &=\max _{p(x)} (H(Y)-H(\alpha)) \\
        &=\max _{\pi}((1-\alpha) H(Y|X = Y)+H(\alpha)-H(\alpha))\\
        &=\log(256) (1- \alpha)
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}  
    Hence the capacity is $8(1-\alpha)$ bits per pigeon, or $96(1-\alpha)$ bits per hour.
    }
    \item { The process can be modeled as a binary symmetric channel. Consider the transmission of a pigeon of 8 bits (256 alphabets), it has the probability of $\frac{\alpha}{256}$ to be changed to a different value. We assume the message sent is $X \in \left\{0, \ldots, 256 \right\}$, the message received is $Y \in \left\{0, \ldots, 256\right\}$. The capacity of a single transmission is
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        C&=\max I(X ; Y) \\
 &=\max H(Y)-H(Y | X) \\
 &=\max H(Y)-\sum p(x) H(Y | X=x) \\
 &=\max H(Y)-H\left(1 - \frac{255\alpha}{256}, \frac{\alpha}{256}, \ldots, \frac{\alpha}{256}\right) \\
 &= 16 + \frac{255}{256}\alpha \log \frac{256-255\alpha}{\alpha} - \log (256 - 255\alpha) 
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}  
    Hence the capacity is $16 + \frac{255}{256}\alpha \log \frac{256-255\alpha}{\alpha} - \log (256 - 255\alpha)$ bits per pigeon, or $12(16 + \frac{255}{256}\alpha \log \frac{256-255\alpha}{\alpha} - \log (256 - 255\alpha))$ bits per hour.

    The maximal capacity will be achieved when $X$ is a function of $Y$, i.e. given $Y$, $X$ can be determined, and that $X$ is normally distributed. A choice of $\mathcal{Z}$ can be $\mathcal{Z}=\left\{0, 5, 10 \right\}$ }

      Note that for any single possible $X$, there will be at most 3 distinct corresponding $Y$. In order to minimize the maximal $H(X+Z)$, we need to set $Z$ to be 3 continuous numbers, so that the uncertainty of $X+Z$ will be minimized. We take $\mathcal{Z}=\left\{0, 1, 2 \right\}$ for example. Let the distribution of $\mathcal{X}$ to be $\left\{p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4 \right\}$ Then
      \begin{equation}
          H(X+Z) = H(\frac{p_1}{3}, \frac{p_1 + p_2}{3}, \frac{p_1+p_2+p_3}{3}, \frac{p_2+p_3+p_4}{3}, \frac{p_3+p_4}{3}, \frac{p_4}{3}) \le \log 6
