\begin{exercise}[Slackness in the Kraft inequality]{An instantaneous code has word lengths $l_{1}, l_{2}, \ldots, l_{m},$ which satisfy the strict inequality
  $\sum_{i=1}^{m} D^{-l_{i}}<1$
  The code alphabet is $\mathcal{D}=\{0,1,2, \ldots, D-1\} .$ Show that there exist arbitrarily long sequences of code symbols in $D^{*}$ which cannot be decoded into sequences of codewords.}
  \begin{proof}
  W.l.o.g., we assume $l_1\le l_2 \le \ldots \le l_m$. Since the coding method is instantaneous, for any coding with the length of $l_i$, there exists no other coding that begins with the $l_i$ corresponding coding. That is to say, if there exists a coding with $l_i$ length, then $D^{l_m-l_i}$ codewords of the $D^{l_m}$ codewords will be decodable. Adding all these decodable words up we have
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^{m} D^{l_m-l_i} = D^{l_m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} D^{-l_i} < D^{l_m}
  \end{equation}
  ,which implies that there exists some prefix words in $D^{l_m}$ that are undecodable. Any arbitrary word that begins with such prefix will be unable to decode into sequence of codewords.

\begin{exercise}[Fix-free codes]{ A code is a fix-free code if it is both a prefix code and a suffix code. Let $l_{1}, l_{2}, \ldots, l_{m}$ be $m$ positive integers. Prove that if
  $\sum_{k=1}^{m} 2^{-l_{k}} \leq \frac{1}{2}$
  then there exists a binary fix-free code with codeword length $l_{1}, l_{2}, \ldots, l_{m}$}
  \begin{proof}
  W.l.o.g., we assume $l_1\le l_2 \le \ldots \le l_m$. We prove by induction on $m$.
  
  When $m=1$, the conclusion is trivial.

  We assume that when $m=k-1$, for any increasingly ordered positive integers $l_1,l_2,\ldots,l_{k-1}$, if $\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 2^{-l_i} \le \frac{1}{2}$, then there exists a binary fix-free code with codeword length $l_1,l_2,\ldots,l_{k-1}$.

  Now let $m=k$. For every particular codeword, in terms of prefix codes, it will occupy the space of $2^{l_m - l_i}$ in the tree, while in terms of suffix codes, it wll also occpy the space of $2^{l_m - l_i}$ in the $2^{l_m}$ nodes. These two sets may overlap, but they will surely be less than $2\times 2^{l_m - l_i}$. Hence for all codewords, we have
  \begin{equation}
    2 \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{l_m - l_i} \le 2^{l_m} 
  \end{equation}
  
  
  It follows that $\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{-l_i} \le \frac{1}{2}$. By removing $l_k$ we have $\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 2^{-l_i} < \frac{1}{2}$. By the induction hypothesis, we know that for $l_1,\ldots,l_{k-1}$ lengths of codewords, they can form a set of fix-free codes. Furthermore, the strict less relation tells us that there still remains space for the codeword $l_k$. Hence, the conclusion follows.

\begin{exercise}[$\frac{3}{4}$ fix-free codes]{ Prove that when
  $$\sum_{k=1}^{m} 2^{-l_{k}} \leq \frac{3}{4}$$  the conclusion above holds.}
  \begin{proof} The proof here is not complete. We try to solve the problem from two perspectives. The proof idea is based on this paper\footnote{R. Ahlswede and B. Balkenhol and L. Khachatrian. Some properties of Fix-Free Codes}.
    \paragraph{There exists no upper bounds greater than $\frac{3}{4}$.} For any $\frac{3}{4}+\epsilon>\frac{3}{4}$, we choose $k$ such that $2^{-k}<\epsilon$. We construct a list of codelengths with $1$ and $2^{k-2}+1$ $k$s. Then we have
    \begin{equation}
      \sum_{i=1}^{N} 2^{-l_i} = \frac{1}{2}+ 2^{-k} (2^{k-2}+1) = \frac{3}{4}+\epsilon
    \end{equation}

    Our choice of codeword lengths satisfies our assumption, however, with the first codeword with length of 1 as a prefix and suffix, there are at most $2^{k-2}$ words of length $k$, which implies that our choice is invalid, contradiction. 

    \paragraph{The conclusion with $\frac{3}{4}$ holds under some restrictions.} We suppose that for all code lengths, either $l_i = l_{i+1}$ or $2l_i \le l_{i+1}$. We prove that under this restriction the conclusion will hold.

    W.l.o.g., we assume that $l_1 \le l_2 \le \ldots \le l_m$. We prove by induction on $m$. The base case of $m=1$ is trivial.

    Assume that for any $n\le m-1$, with $\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{-l_i} \le \frac{3}{4}$ we can construct $n$ different codeword lengths. We prove that this holds for the case of $m$.
    
    Let $m'$ be the largest index $i$ with $l_i < l_{m'}$. By induction hypothesis we can construct a fix-free code $C'$ with the lengths $l_1, \ldots, l_{m'}$. Note for every particular word with length $l_i$, it will occupy at most $2\times 2^{l_{m}-l_i}$ nodes due to the prefix and suffix rule. However, with our restriction, $2^{l_m - 2l_i}$ nodes will be returned, since they will not actually be used as codewords. Therefore, at the $l_m$ level, at most $2 \sum_{i=1}^{m'} 2^{l_m-l_i}- \sum_{i=1}^{m'}2^{l_{m} - 2l_i}$ nodes will be occupied.\footnote{The paper gives a more detailed formula, but I can't fully understand how the last component formula is derived. Fortunately leaving the that component out will not affect the proof here. }

    To ensure that the remaining $l_{m'+1},\ldots,l_m$ can be added to the orginal code system we should have

    \begin{equation}
      2 \sum_{i=1}^{m'} 2^{l_m -l_i}- \sum_{i=1}^{m'}2^{l_m - 2l_i} \le 2^{l_m} - (m -m')
      \label{eqn1}
    \end{equation}

    Writing $K = m - m'$ and $\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^{m'} 2^{-l_i}$. (\ref{eqn1}) can be written as

    \begin{equation}
      2\alpha - \alpha^2 \le 1 - \frac{K}{2^{l_m}}
    \end{equation}

    With abbreviation $\beta = \sum_{i=1}^{m} 2^{-l_i} = \alpha + \frac{K}{2^{l_m}}$ and $\delta = \frac{K}{2^{l_m}}$ we get the equivalent inequality

    \begin{equation}
      \beta \le 1+\delta - \sqrt{\delta}
    \end{equation}

    Note $\delta \in (0,1)$, the right side has the minimal value of $\frac{3}{4}$ at $\delta = \frac{1}{4}$. Thus for any $ \sum_{i=1}^{m} 2^{-l_i} \le \frac{3}{4}$, the conclusion holds.

  \end{proof}

  What is the average message length of the next symbol conditioned on the previous state $X_{n}=i$ using this coding scheme? What is the unconditional average number of bits per source symbol? Relate this to the entropy rate $H(\mathcal{U})$ of the Markov chain.

        \mathbf{\mu} \mathbf{1}^T = 1
      \end{array}\right. \Rightarrow \mu = \left[\frac{2}{9}, \frac{4}{9},\frac{1}{3}\right]

    The average length is
    \begin{equation}
      \sum_{i=1}^{3} \mu_{i} \sum_{j=1}^{3} L(C_{ij}) = \frac{2}{9}\cdot\frac{3}{2} + \frac{4}{9} \cdot\frac{3}{2}+\frac{1}{3}\cdot 1 = \frac{4}{3}
    \end{equation}
    The entropy rate can be calculated as
    \begin{equation}
      H(\mathcal{U})=-\sum_{i j} \mu_{i} P_{i j} \log P_{i j} = \frac{4}{3}
    \end{equation}
    They are the same because the optimal code length is its entropy, which can be expressed with the notion of ``average'' entropy $\frac{1}{n} H(U_1,U_2,\ldots,U_n,\ldots)$, which approximates to $H(\mathcal{U})$.
