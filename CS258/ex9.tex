  From Theorem 8.6.5 [Cover] we know that the Gaussian distribution maximizes the entropy over all distributions with the same variance. Hence it is clear that normally distributed $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P)$ will maximize the mutual information. In this case $(Y_1,Y_2) \sim \left(0, \left[\begin{array}{cc}
    P+N & P+\rho N \\
    P +\rho N & P + N
  \end{array}\right]\right)$
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      \max I(X;Y_1,Y_2) &= h(Y_1,Y_2) - h(Y_1,Y_2|X) \\
      &= h(Y_1,Y_2) - h(Z_1,Z_2) \\
      &= \frac{1}{2} \log \left(2\pi e\right)^2 \left|\begin{array}{cc}
        P+N & P+\rho N \\
        P +\rho N & P + N

        N \rho & N

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\rho = 1$, $C = \frac{1}{2} \log \left(1 + \frac{P}{N}\right)$
    \item $\rho = 0$, $C = \frac{1}{2} \log \left(1 + \frac{2P}{N}\right)$

\begin{exercise}[Exponential noise channels]{ $\quad Y_{i}=X_{i}+Z_{i},$ where $Z_{i}$ is i.i.d. exponentially distributed noise with mean $\mu$. Assume that we have a mean constraint on the signal (i.e., $E X_{i} \leq \lambda$ ). Show that the capacity of such a channel is $C=\log \left(1+\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)$}
  \begin{proof}
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      I(X;Y) &= h(Y) - h(Y|X) \\
      &= h(Y) - h(Z)\\
      &= h(Y) - \sum_i h(Z_i) \\
      &\le \sum_i \left(h(Y_i) - h(Z_i)\right)
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  The equailty holds when $Y_i$s are independent, which can be obtained if $X_i$s are independent. Hence we can only consider the channel for the input and output to be single-valued. Still, $I(X;Y) = h(Y) - h(Z)$ holds.

  Note for exponentially distributed $Z$,
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      h(Z) &= - \int_{0}^{+\infty} g(z) \ln  \frac{1}{\mu} e^{-\frac{z}{\mu}}  dz \\
      &= - \int_{0}^{+\infty} g(z) \ln  \frac{1}{\mu}   dz - \int_{0}^{+\infty} g(z) \frac{z}{\mu}  dz \\
      &= 1 + \ln \mu 
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}

  Note that $EY = EX + EZ \le \lambda + \mu$.  For mean-value bounded $Y$, by Theorem 12.1.1 and Example 12.2.5 [Cover], the maximizing differential entropy is $h^{*}(Y) = 1 + \ln (\lambda + \mu)$, with distribution $p^{*}(y) = \frac{1}{\lambda + \mu} e^{- \frac{y}{\lambda + \mu}}$. Therefore
  \begin{equation}
    I(X;Y) \le \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\left(1 + \ln(\lambda + \mu)\right)- \left(1 + \ln(\mu)\right)\right) = n \ln \frac{\lambda + \mu}{\mu}
  \end{equation}

  The equailty holds when $X_i$ are independent with mean value $\lambda$ and $Y_i \sim \text{exp} \left(\frac{1}{\lambda+\mu}\right)$. We need to find such distribution for $X_i$. Since $X_i$ and $Z_i$ are independent and $Y_i = X_i + Z_i$, it follows that the characteristc functions hold the following relation.
  \begin{equation}
    \phi_Y (t) = \phi_X (t) \cdot \phi_Z(t)
  \end{equation}
  Therefore
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      \phi_X (t) &= \frac{\phi_Y(t)}{\phi_Z(t)} \\
      &= \frac{\left(1 - i(\lambda + \mu)t\right)^{-1}}{\left( 1 - i \mu t\right)^{-1}} \\
      &= \frac{1}{\lambda + \mu} \frac{\left[\mu - i \mu (\lambda + \mu)t\right] + \lambda}{1 - i(\lambda + \mu)t} \\
      &= \frac{\mu}{\lambda + \mu} + \frac{\lambda}{\lambda + \mu} \left(1 - i (\lambda + \mu)t\right)^{-1}
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}

  The characteristc function above is a linear combination of two kinds of distribution. We can set every $X_i$ to be 0 with the probability of $\frac{\mu}{\lambda + \mu}$, and to be exponentially distributed with mean value $\lambda + \mu$ by the probability of $\frac{\lambda}{\mu + \lambda}$. Then the channel capacity $ n \ln \frac{\lambda + \mu}{\mu} $ can be obtained.

  \end{proof}
