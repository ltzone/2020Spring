\begin{block}{I-Measure}
  A theory which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between Shannon's information measure and set theory in full generality.

    \begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
    H / I & \leftrightarrow \mu^{*} &&  , & \leftrightarrow \cup \\
    ; & \leftrightarrow \cap &&    | & \leftrightarrow -
    \end{aligned}\end{equation}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Non-negative Decomposition of Multivariate Information}
  A measure of \emph{redundancy information} that a set of sources provides about a given variable.
  
  Shannon information can be decomposed into atoms of non-negative \emph{partial information}.
\end{block}


Our Goal: Using the I-Measure methodology to study the redundancy measure, forming a set-theoretic view of partial information.
