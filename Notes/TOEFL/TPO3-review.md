### Reading 1: Evolution of Architecture

7\. According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true about materials used in the construction of buildings?

> *Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired. Enormous changes in materials and techniques of construction within the last few generations have made it possible to enclose space with much greater ease and speed and with a minimum of material.*
- WA: Architects in earlier times did not have **enough** building materials to enclose large spaces
- RA: The **availability of suitable** building materials no longer limits the types of structures that may be built
- Analysis: B整段大量篇幅在讨论building material，建议用排除法。A的new building material定位到第四句，但是A选项的hard to find明显和这句话矛盾，错误；同样B选项也定位到这一句，no long limits和这句话吻合，正确，选B: Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired. C的三种材料定位到第三句的列举部分，但很明显，他们应该是以前的主要建筑材料，不是现在。In earlier times it was necessary to design structural systems suitable for the materials that were available, such as wood, stone, brick. D没说选项在原文没有提及，看上去长得像倒数第二句，但意思不同。
- 错因: 正确理解选项, 关键是type不是enough


9\. Which of the following correctly characterizes the relationship between the human body and architecture that is described in paragraph 5?

> *Modern architectural forms generally have three separate components comparable to elements of the human body: a supporting skeleton or frame, an outer skin enclosing the interior spaces, and equipment, similar to the body’s vital organs and systems. The equipment includes plumbing, electrical wiring, hot water, and air-conditioning. Of course in early architecture—such as igloos and adobe structures—there was no such equipment, and the skeleton and skin were often one.*

- WA: Complex equipment inside buildings is the one element in modern architecture that resembles **a component** of the human body.
- RA: In general, modern buildings more closely resemble the human body than earlier buildings do.
- Analysis: D本段将建筑结构与人体的结构进行了比较，发现三个共同点。排除法，A以equipment做关键词定位至第一句的最后半句，equipment像的应该是vital organs and systems，不是一个component： Modern architectural forms generally..., and equipment, similar to the body’s vital organs and systems. B以early building做关键词定位至文章最后一句，skeleton和skin是一样的，所以和人不同： Of course in early architecture—such as igloos and adobe structures—there was no such equipment, and the skeleton and skin were often one. C的change原文没说； D正确因为原文说现代建筑像人体（和A选项一样，对应第一句），以前的建筑的skeleton和skin是一个（和B一样对应最后一句），所以现代建筑比之前的建筑更像人体。
- 错因: 主旨句>例证句, A(不完全)对应第二句, 但本段主旨句强调三个部分都像人体, 且后续论述表明modern比earlier更像.

14\. Summary: Architecture uses forms and space to express culture values
A. Architects seek to create buildings that are both visually appealing and well suited for human use
B. Over the course of the history of building, innovations in material and methods of construction have given architects ever greater freedom to express themselves.
D. Both clients and archiects are responsible for _the mediocre(平庸) designs of some modern buildings_
F. The discovery and use of the arch typifies the way in which architecture advances by developing more efficient types of structures.
- WA: BDF
- RA: ABF
- Analysis: Architects选项对应全文首段首句，正确。Over选项对应第四段第三句和第三段首句，正确。Throughout选项与第五段首句相反，错。Both选项是细节，不选。Modern选项错，因为原文没说现代的建筑不好看，不选。The discovery选项第六段最后一句，正确
- 错因: 漏读选项D题目中的细节, 对A的generalization过于谨慎.

### Reading 2: Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer

18\. The word "ensuing" in the passage is closet in meaning to
> *The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the drought years of the early 1930s. The **ensuing** rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture, especially from the 1950s onward, transformed the economy of the region.*
- WA: continuing
- RA: subsequent
- Analysis: ensue跟随，接下来，所以subsequent是答案。原文说第一批水井是1930s挖掘的，ensuing所在的那句话又说1950s什么样的农业的快速扩张，这两个时间说明动作是有先后的，而且first一般必然有下文的，所以应该是接着的。注意continuing是个很大的迷惑项，继续是指一个动作的延续，而接下来是两件事情接着发生.
- 错因: continuing = continuous

20\. The word “unprecedented” in the passage is closest in meaning to
> *This **unprecedented** development of a finite groundwater resource with an almost negligible natural recharge rate—that is, virtually no natural water source to replenish the water supply—has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically.*
- WA: without any restriction
- RA: unlike anything in the past
- Analysis: unprecedented: 史无前例的，un表示没有，pre前，想到precede，在……之前。A是很难控制；B是没有限制；C是和过去的任何东西都不同；D是快速扩张。根据词意，C正确。 A难以控制和B毫无限制都有轻微贬义，而原词只是在叙述一个事实，属中性。D快速扩张也不沾边，而且A/B/D三个选项在意思上有共同点，唯独C不同，只要知道pre是前就一定能选出答案
- 错因: 词根分析 > 你认为的语义, 选项分组法

### Reading 3: The Long-Term Stability of Ecosystems
31\. According to paragraph 2, which of the following principles of ecosystems can be learned by studying a pond?
> *An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it relatively unchanged in a year’s time. Individual fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will tend to be the same from one year to the next. We can say that the properties of an ecosystem are **more stable** than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem.*
- WA: A change in the members of an organism does not affect an ecosystem's properties
- RA: Ecosystem properties change more slowly than individuals in the system
- 错因: 警惕直接对应, 读题

42\. Summary: The process of succession and the stability of a climax community can change over time.
B. A high degree of species diversity does not always result in a stable ecosystem.
C. Disagreements over the meaning of the term "stability" make it difficult to identify the most stable systems.
D. Ecologists agree that climax communities are the most stable types of ecosystems.
E. The level of resilience in a plant community contributes to its long-term stability.
- WA: BCD
- RA: BCE
- Analysis: The changes选项与原文首段的最后一句意思相反，不选。A high degree选项对应原文第三段和第五段的首句，第四段的最后一句，正确。The level选项对应原文第六段首句，Ecologists选项与原文第三段第四段的首句意思相反，不选。Disagreements选项对应原文第四段第二句，正确。The resilience选项原文没说，原文第六段说不知道为什么生物群落能抵抗破坏，不选。
  > *[6] Ecologists are especially interested to know what factors contribute to the resilience of communities because climax communities all over the world are being severely damaged or destroyed by human activities.*
- 错因: 选不出E, 原因在没能把*resilience*和*long-term stability*联系起来, 其实第七段也可以找到对应
  > *[7] Many ecologists now think that the **relative long-term stability of climax communities** comes not from diversity but from the “patchiness” of the environment*

## Listening

> 得分32/34 (27/30), 错在一篇环境Lecture的主旨题, 和一篇Art Lecture的细节题

1\.6\. What does the professor mainly discuss?
- WA: Major changes in the migratory patterns of humming birds
- RA: Concern about the reduction of hummingbird habitat
- Analysis: But后的内容才是今天的主题。B选项与文中事实不符。A 选项看似迷惑但是重点在impact 和habitat loss导致它们数量减少，而不是change。虽然有提到migratory但是只是为了解释它在迁移途中需要消耗大量能量，而不是讨论它们迁移路线的变化
  > Now, we’ve been talking about the loss of animal habitat from housing developments, uh …, growing cities – small habitat losses. But today I wanna begin talking about what happens when habitat is reduced across a large area. So what’s the **impact of habitat loss on those animals – animals that need large areas of habitat**? 
- 错因: 缺少选项比对, 开头主旨笔记缺失

2\.8\. What is the professor's opinion about the art at the Chauvet cave?
- WA: It probably reflected artists' religious beliefs
- RA: It is extremely well done
- Analysis: Pro先说人们对于那时的人的映像是十分原始的，从but后转折的内容anything but primitive. They are masterpieces. 可以看出PRO给予了极高的肯定也就是It is extremely well done.
- 错因: 理解**anything but = not**, 漏听细节

## Writing 

### Integrated Writing: Fake Painting or Not

#### Initial Try & Corrections
A painting of woman has long been doubted whether it was actually painted by Rembrandt, a famous seventeenth-century Dutch painter. However, recent studies have confirmed this fact by refuting three perspectives of doubts.

First of all, for the inconsistency of the woman's outfit, it is revealed that the luxurious fur was added about a hundred years later after the painting was made. The original painting was a typically-dressed servant. The luxurious fur collar was added later in order to make the painting more formal and valuable,~~ making the painting looks unlike Rembrandt's work.~~

The extra fur collar can also help address the light and shadow issue in the painting. _By removing the fur collar, we can find that the woman was originally wearing a simple light-colored cloth, so that her face would be illuminated by the light reflected from below, instead of being darkened by the mannually-added fur collar that is supposed to absorb lights._ In the original painting, the light fits the reality well enough, which is just what we _are expecting_ from Rembrandt as a master of light and shadow.

Finally, for the back of the painting, it is also confirmed _by studies_ that the extra wood panels glued together _were also added_ by other people in order to enlarge the painting, making it more grand and appealing. In fact, further research in the wood reveals that the base panel comes from the _exact tree used in a self-portrait~~ed~~, which has already been considered to be one of Rembrandt's pieces of work._ Therefore, there should be little doubt that this painting of woman comes from Rembrandt.

#### Sample Answer

The lecture revises the idea presented in the text, that Rembrandt was not the artist who painted the famous painting **"Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet"(Missing Information)**.

The inconsistency between the white cap, which **identifies the woman as a servant**, and the expensive fur collar she wears **dissolves** as the Professor explains that the fur collar was apparently painted **over** the original painting to increase its worth by displaying an **aristocratic(贵族的)** woman.

In addition, the assumption that light and shadow in the painting do not fit together is refuted by the fact that in the original painting, the woman worn a light cloth that illuminated her face. Thus **the presentation of light and shadow** was indeed very realistic and accurate, as it is characteristic of Rembrandt’s paintings.

Finally, **the mystery of** the panel consisting of patches glued together is also solved in the lecture. Actually, the wood panel was later enlarged to make it more grand and valuable, but the original painting was painted on a single panel, **as Rembrandt would have done it**. Furthermore, the wood is of the same tree used in other Rembrandt paintings, like the "Self-Portrait with a Hat". All this information **points to** Rembrandt as the painter of the controversial painting.

#### Remark
- 句式多样化
  - 前后对比用but
  - ... ,like ...
  - no more 'for A, for B, ...'!!!
    - ... dissolves as the professor explains that ...
    - the assumption that ... is refuted by
    - the mystery of ... is also resloved
  - was **later** enlarged/painted
- 小词
  - points to
  - the mystery of (replace problem/issue)
  - identify sb. as
  - the presentation of light and shadow
- aristocratic

### Independent Writing: Keep Old Friends or Make New Friends?

#### Initial Try & Corrections
Friends are those particular individuals in our life with whom we can share our heart and soul. The fast-paced modern life has made it difficult to maintain a true relationship between people, making a friendship even more valuable. However, in reality, many people are faced with the dillema wheter to keep our old friends or to make new friends. From my perspective, old friends matter more.

First of all, old friends know more about us. As has been mentioned before, we need friends to share our emotions. It is definitely easier to fulfill our spritual needs with a person with common stories and perspectives on life than a person who we know little about. _On the other hand, it is also a great loss for us to lose a good old friend if we don't take this relationship seriously._ *(Confusing Logic, explain the reason before the argument might be better)*

Furthermore, looking for new friends means distributing our socializing time and energy to a borader scale. Psychologists have already concluded that one can only maintain a deep relationship with at most ten to twenty individuals. To make new friends, we must sacrifice our old friendships, which may gradually develop into a irreversible windening gap between ourselves and our old friends. *(Lack of development)*

Moreover, failure to keep our old friends may reduce our self-recognition. There can be many reasons for an unworking new friendship, like incompatible hobbies or unshared values of life. _However,_ *(?)* old friendships have the least reason not to maintain. One of my classmate used to get depressed for a whole month just because she had a misunderstanding with her closest friend. She could have avoided such suffering if she had spent more time communicating and understanding with her friend. In a word, losing an old friend may take far more than making a new friend _than we expect._

Given all the reasons above, I firmly believe that it is more important to keep our old friends close to us. I am not suggesting that we should stay away from new friends. What I want to say is never to forget how valuable a true friendship is, which often lies between you and your old friends. *(Still lack of development)*


#### Good Expressions from the Sample Answer
- **shared happinesses and sorrows** 
- **read me from my facial expressions**. 
- give me warm comfort if I feel upset.

#### Remark
- Lack of development
  - e.g. why not easy to make new friends? as we grow, we care more about ourselves and families. colleagues are not friends, etc...
