### Task 3: 要不要取消校园巴士 

#### My Script

 The men disagree with the school's plan to eliminate the bus service for two reasons. The first one is that the routes are now out of date, since it only goes through the places that are too expensive for students to live in second, the plan is actually encouraging students to drive to the school. Since the bus service is replaced by more parking lots, this will only create more noise and traffic on the campus and thus leading to increasing need of parking spaces. So the situation will only get worse with the school's plan to eliminate bus service. That's the reason why the man doesn't agree with this plan.
