## Reading

> 得分35/39, 错误集中在第二篇, "The Origins of Cetaceans"

14.  In paragraph 1, what does the author say about the presence of a blowhole in cetaceans?
  *Their(Cetaceans) streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke and blowhole cannot **disguise their affinities** with land dwelling mammals.*
  WA: It cannot conceal the fact that cetaceans are mammals
  RA: It's the main difference between cetaceans and land-dwelling mammals
  错因: 生词 disguise 伪装, affinity 亲密关系,类同

22. Why does the author use the word “luckily” in mentioning that the Ambulocetus natans fossil included hind legs?
  *The fossil luckily includes a good portion of the hind legs*
  WA: Fossil legs of early whales are a rare find.
  RA: The legs provided important information about the evolution of cetaceans.
  解析: luckily所在句，和后面两句话都是在描述hing leg的发现的意义，连起来读找到他所支撑的主旨句，即这一段的的第六句话： *The fossil luckily includes a good portion of the hind legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea*. luckily意为"幸运地"，称其"幸运"是就化石的科学价值而言：因为它具有a good portion of the hind leg(比例完整的后肢)，从而（在第六句中）使科学家推出"The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea"（A动物为水陆两栖）。综上，正是由于legs提供了重要的科学信息，人们才称它luckily，因此选择B
  错因: 未根据文章主旨考虑, 选择了过于肤浅(也与事实不尽相符)的答案

24.  The word “propulsion” in the passage is closest in meaning to 
  *The large hind legs were used for propulsion in water.*
  WA: staying float
  RA: moving forward
  解析: propulsion: 推进。Pro这个前缀有向前的意思，所以正确答案是D。A是保持漂浮；B是改变方向；C是减少重量。对应原文The large hind legs were used for propulsion in water.这里说了大的后肢是用来在水中propusion的，这里4个选项带进去貌似都碎，但从pro这个前缀来判断，还是D最正确。
  错因: 词缀分析

### Task 2: 应该多选课还是少选课

#### My Script

I believe that taking a wide variety of courses is better for college students. First of all, and it can help _build student broaden students' horizons_ and enhance their school life quality. Take my friend is an example. He majors in laws but he study a lot of music classes. _he does relaxing helps_ a lot in the music classes. Second student should remember that they are training for their future instead of just a job career. So it is important to enhance their comprehensive ability via various courses.

### Task 3: 要不要取消校园巴士 

#### My Script

 The men disagree with the school's plan to eliminate the bus service for two reasons. The _first one is that_ the routes are now out of date, since it only goes through the places that are too expensive for students to live in second, the plan is actually encouraging students to drive to the school. _Since ?_ the bus service is replaced by more parking lots, this will only create more noise and traffic on the campus and thus leading to increasing need of parking spaces. So the **situation will only get worse** with the school's plan to eliminate bus service. That's the reason why the man doesn't agree with this plan.

### Independent Writing: Always Telling the truth in relationship?

#### Initial Try & My Corrections

In modern society, individuals are mutually connected ~~with each other~~ more than ever before. As a result, maintaining a good relationship between people becomes critical. From my point of view, the most important consideration ~~in any relationship~~ is to always keep telling the truth.

To begin with, telling the truth opens your heart to the people around you. Truth carries our true feelings. By telling the truth _we also telling how_ _we feel about ourselves, how we trust the person in front us, and how we want that person to share our feelings._ In response, the listener will realize that he or she is a trustworthy person to talk to, thus having a better understanding of the speaker. Telling the truth build a wonderful bridge for sharing emotions, leading to a strengthened social bonding.

Besides, truth also helps build one's social image. _Imagine this case, a person who has a bad reputation for being dishonest even in front of his closet friends, and a person who is always nice and genuine to everyone._ We will definitely choose the latter one when we search for help. In a word, telling the truth will not only bring your friends closer, but also attract more people ~~to get to~~ begin a wonderful relationship with you.

Some may argue that it's hard to keep telling the truth, since truth can hurt. Truth may not sound sweet for others, or it may make us vulnerable to bad words. However, by no means should a lie be the solution, for a white lie may help relieve the curret situation, but once a lie is started, hundreds of lies will follow up, just to make up for that single lie. Lies will keep piling up, and eventually, lead to the ~~decrepacy~~*(discrepancy:差异,disruption)* of a relationship. Therefore, it is extremely important to keep a habit of being true when we communicate.

To conclude, _the magic of truth in socializing is self-evident_. As private individuals, we should always remember to keep telling the truth to everyone in our life.

> - Choose the right words!

#### Analysis in OG

This topic supports a variety of approaches. Some writers disagree with the statement and describe instances where to them it is appropriate to lie; typically these include **white lies, lies to avoid hurting others, and lies in a business context** (which often have more to do with not disclosing proprietary information than with outright lying). Others take the position that lies **beget more lies and undermine trust**. These writers present **examples** that support the statement. Still others look at both sides of the issue, often **delineating or classifying situations** where they consider lying appropriate and others where they consider lying inappropriate or more consequential. **The telling of stories —real and hypothetical— is not inappropriate**; it is reasonable to illustrate one’s ideas on this topic with examples.

#### Score 5 Essay in OG

DISHONESY KILLS RELIABILITY

There are certain considerations or factors that everyone takes into account in a relationship. People may look for honesty, **altruism, understanding, loyalty, being thoughtful, etc**! Everyone would more or less wish that the person he is dealing with, has some of these virtues above. Putting them in an order according to their importance, however, can be very subjective and relative.

When someone asks him/herself the question “What do I consider to be the most important thing in my relationship?” the answer depends on a lot of factors, such as how his/her earlier relationships were.

After stating that everyone’s opinion can be different about this, for me **honesty, in other words, always telling the truth** *(Good Abbrevation)* is the most important consideration in a relationship. **Opposite of this** is inarguably lying and if someone needs to lie, either s/he is hiding something or is afraid of telling me something.

In any relationship of mine, I would wish that first of all, the person I’m dealing with is honest. Even though s/he thinks that s/he did something wrong that I wouldn’t like, s/he’d better tell me the truth and not lie about it. Later on if I find out about a lie or hear the truth from someone else, **that’d be much more unpleasant**. In that case how can I ever believe or trust that person again? How can I ever believe that this person has enough confidence in me to forgive him/her and carry on with the relationship from there. So if I cannot trust a person anymore, **if the person doesn’t think I can handle the truth, there’s no point to continuing that relationship**.

Although I would like to see altruistic, understanding, thoughtful and loyal behavior from people, **an instance of the opposite of these behaviors** would not **upset** me as much as dishonesty would. Among all the possible behaviors, dishonesty is the only one for me that terminates how I feel about a person’s reliability. Therefore honesty would be my first concern and the most important consideration
in a relationship.


> Rater Comments
> In this response the writer first approaches the topic **by underscoring that a number of character traits** are important to a relationship. The writer then effectively **develops** an argument that, unlike other negative behaviors, dishonesty or unwillingness to fully disclose some bad action cannot be forgiven and can be the most important factor in destroying a relationship. The writer’s language is fluent, accurate, and varied enough to effectively support the progression and connection of ideas. There is a variety of sentence structures, including rhetorical questions. The essay is not mechanically perfect, but as long as such errors are occasional, are minor, and do not interfere with the reader’s understanding, an essay like this one can still earn a top score.


### Integrated Writing: Four-day Working Policy

#### Initial Try & Correction by Myself

The lecturer proposes three opposing opinions on the four-day workweek policy.

First of all, hiring four-day employees won't create extra benefits for companies. The lecturer _addressed_ *(Inappropriate here, address is more formal)* that adding new workers will cause ~~more~~ expenditure other than salaries, such as extra training costs, employees' health insurance, and more working facilities. _Therefore, we can't just simply count the salary costs to substantiate that shortened workweek will not result in additional payroll costs._ *(Logic Confusion)*

Secondly, in terms of social benefits, offering four-day option to employees will not reduce unemployment rates. _Driven by profits, many companies will choose to enforce employees to work extra hours or raise their daily workload in order to make up for their off-work day productivity._ *(Too Long Sentence)* As a result, few extra jobs will be available, and more people may feel unpleasant ~~in~~ *about* their jobs.

Furthermore, as for the workers, the four-day schedule may not raise their life quality as expected. With a four-day workweek, they _may be threatened with a risk_ of losing their chances of promotion. Compared with those full-time workers, they are more likely to lose jobs during a business crisis.

#### Sample Answer

The passage argues that four-day work week will benefit companies, the whole economy, and individuals. But in the lecture, the professor holds a totally different view that no one will be beneficial from the new work week.

Firstly, the passage says that companies will get more profits for employees can work more effectively. However, the lecture points out that four-day workweek will lead to spend more. That is because companies have to spend more money on training, **medical benefits**, ~~office positions~~, even new computers.

Secondly, the passage claims that the whole economy will benefit, for the four-day workweek is a way to reduce unemployment rates. The lecture **refutes the idea completely.** **Admittedly**, there are more available jobs, but companies will prefer to let employees work overtime to finish them for hiring new staff is too expensive. In addition, the companies may **lift their expectation that** staff finish five-day jobs within four-day.

Thirdly, the passage suggests that individual employees can benefit from it. _Though the four-day workweek can provide more leisure time to employees_ *(Missing in answer)*, the lecture argues against the passage. Comparing to five-day workers, the four-day workweek employees may be the first one to be fire during economic depression. And they will have less chance to promotion _because companies wish that managers could be on duty every work day_ *(Missing in answer)*
